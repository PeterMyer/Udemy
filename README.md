# Udemy

A repository to store all code from Udemy courses and tutorials. Chose to move to a consolidated repository with subtree's to make what I am currently learning and previous courses more easily visibile for others. Additionally, I hope this will improve course tracking for myself and reduce chances of 'dead' tutorial repos.
